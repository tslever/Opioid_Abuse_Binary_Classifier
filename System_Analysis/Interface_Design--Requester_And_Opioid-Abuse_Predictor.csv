Inputs from Requester,,,
,Name,Attributes,Notes
,A_Patient,"A matrix of events corresponding to a medical subject who does not exhibit cancer and has at least one opioid prescription in their medical history.
Each event is a column vector.","We justify a patient being a matrix of events corresponding to a medical subject who does not exhibit cancer following
""Identifying risk of opioid use disorder for patients taking opioid medications with deep learning"", which reads:
""Because opioid medications have proven successful in treatment of cancer pain,
cancer patients may receive many more opioid prescriptions than other patients.
This fact may lead the model to misclassify these patients as having OUD, so we removed all patients with cancer diagnosis."""
