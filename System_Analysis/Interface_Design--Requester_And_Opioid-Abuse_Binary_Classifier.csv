Inputs from Requester,,,
,Name,Attributes,Notes
,A_Patient,"A matrix of events corresponding to a medical subject who does not exhibit cancer and has at least one opioid prescription in their medical history.
Each event is a column vector.","We justify a patient being a matrix of events corresponding to a medical subject who does not exhibit cancer following
""Identifying risk of opioid use disorder for patients taking opioid medications with deep learning"", which reads:
""Because opioid medications have proven successful in treatment of cancer pain,
cancer patients may receive many more opioid prescriptions than other patients.
This fact may lead the model to misclassify these patients as having OUD, so we removed all patients with cancer diagnosis."""

,Term,Definition,
,An_Event,An occurrence prior to Requester's request,
,,"An event is also a vector constructed by concatenating a Diagnosis_Vector, a Medication_Vector, A_Procedure_Vector, A_Condition_Vector, A_Clinical_Results_Vector, and A_Persona_Characteristics_Vector",
,A_Diagnosis_Vector,"A vector of 0's and 1's where each binary digit represents absence or presence of a specific Diagnosis.
All of and only those of the Diagnoses below will be included in A_Diagnosis_Vector.",
,A_Medication_Vector,"A vector of numbers where each binary digit represents absence or presence of a specific Medication.
All of and only those of the Medications below will be included in A_Medication_Vector.",
,A_Procedure_Vector,"A vector of 0's and 1's where each binary digit represents absence or presence of a specific Procedure.
All of and only those of the Procedures below will be included in A_Procedure_Vector.",
,An_Observation_Vector,"A vector of 0's and 1's where each binary digit represents absence or presence of a specific Observation.
All of and only those of the Observations below will be included in An_Observation_Vector.",
,A_Clinical_Results_Vector,"A vector of 0's and 1's where each binary digit represents absence or presence of a specific Clinical Result.
All of and only those of the Clinical Results below will be included in A_Clinical_Results_Vector.",
,A_Personal_Characteristics_Vector,"A vector of 0's and 1's where:
The first 5 binary digits will correspond to a patient's annual income being in the corresponding quintiles of income for citizens of the United States.
The sixth and seventh binary digits will correspond to a patient being of Female, Male, and Non-Binary Gender. Non-Binary Gender will be the reference class indicated by both digits being 0.
The eighth binary digit will be 0 if the patient's biological parents do not abuse drugs and 1 if the patient's biological parents do abuse drugs.
The ninth binary digit will be 0 if the patient is not homeless and 1 if the patient is homeless.
The tenth binary digit will be 0 if the patient is single and 1 if the patient is partnered.
The eleventh binary digit will be 0 if this event is not associated with substance abuse and 1 if this event has indicated an assocation with substance abuse.
The twelfth binary digit will be 0 if this event is not associated with pre-adolescent sexual abuse and 1 if this event is associated with pre-adolescent sexual abuse. 
The thirteenth binary digit will be 0 if the patient is not obese and 1 if the patient is obese.",
,Diagnosis,A medical diagnosis. One of:,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that this event is not associated with Depression and 1 indicates that this event is associated with Depression. ,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents no presence of Current Substance Abuse and 1 represents presence of Current Substance Abuse.,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that this event is not associated with Substance Abuse and 1 represents that this event is associated with Substance Abuse. ,
,Medication,A drug used for medical treatment. One of:,
,,Drug- and recency-weighted running sum of prescriptions of ibuprofen across events,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that ibuprofen has not been prescribed during this event and 1 represents that ibuprofen has been prescribed during this event,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that ibuprofen has not been prescribed ever and 1 represents that ibuprofen has been prescribed ever,
,,Number of days that ibuprofen is prescribed for this event,
,,Drug and recency-weighted running sum of prescriptions of acetaminophen across events,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that ibuprofen has not been prescribed during this event and 1 represents that acetaminophen has been prescribed during this event,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that acetaminophen has not been prescribed ever and 1 represents that acetaminophen has been prescribed ever,
,,Number of days that acetaminophen is prescribed for this event,
,Procedure,"A specific action or series of actions undertaken by healthcare professionals to diagnose, treat, manage, or prevent a medical condition or illness. One of:",
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that this event does not relate to tonsillectomy and 1 represents that this event relates to tonsillectomy,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that this event does not relate to appendectomy and 1 represents that this event relates to appendectomy,
,,Binary digit where 0 represents that this event does not relate to hip replacement and 1 represents that this event relates to hip replacement,
,A_Clinical_Result,"A measurable change in symptoms, overall health, ability to function, quality of life, or survival outcomes that result from giving care to patients. One of:",
